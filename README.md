## Project Description

A **Multi-Stage Recipe Management System** will be developed as an integral feature of a smart restaurant POS (Point of Sale) solution. This system is designed to streamline kitchen operations by automating the deduction of raw materials and inventory based on real-time recipe usage.

* **Automated Ingredient Deduction:**
    * Restaurant management uploads each dish's recipe into the system.
    * Automatic ingredient tracking and stock adjustments.
    * When a dish is ordered and billed, corresponding ingredient quantities are deducted from inventory based on the pre-defined recipe structure.

* **Multi-Stage Preparation Support:**
    * Supports intermediate items (e.g., sauces, dough, pre-mixes) used across multiple final dishes.
    * Tracks ingredient usage and applies deductions at *each* stage of preparation, not just at the final sale.
    * Maintains a highly accurate reflection of stock levels without manual intervention.

* **Proactive Stock Management & Analytics:**
    * Notifies kitchen or purchasing department when stock levels reach a predefined threshold to avoid unexpected stock-outs.
    * Generates real-time consumption analytics and usage patterns.
    * Enables informed decisions regarding inventory purchasing and wastage control.

* **Operational Benefits:**
    * Improves operational efficiency.
    * Minimizes human error.
    * Enables better forecasting.

* **Integration & Security:**
    * Ensures seamless integration with existing POS infrastructure.
    * Defines user roles to control access to inventory data and recipe modifications.

* **Overall Goal:**
    * Provides a seamless, intelligent, and self-updating inventory solution to modernize and optimize restaurant management practices.
